## Introduction

Barcode reading is a common requirement in various applications such as inventory management, hospitals, retail, ticketing, and more. The Zebra Crossing (ZXing) library is an open-source image processing library that supports reading various types of barcodes like QR codes, UPC codes, and more. This project provides a simple React application that integrates the ZXing library to read barcodes from images or live camera input.

## Features

- Scan barcodes from webcam
- Display barcode text on the screen
- Simple and easy-to-understand React codebase
- Utilizes the power of ZXing image processing library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drchaney/react-barcode-reader.git
cd react-barcode-reader
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the React Barcode Reader application.

3. To scan barcodes using the live camera, click on the "Start Scanning" button. Grant necessary camera permissions if prompted. Point the camera towards a barcode, and the application will read and display the barcode information in real-time.  Click "Stop Scanning" to turn off your camera.
